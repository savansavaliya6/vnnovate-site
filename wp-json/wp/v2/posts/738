Top Reasons to go Cloud-Native Approach"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>2020 posed a new challenge for businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and companies had to adopt remote working models? A whopping&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/doi\/10.1073\/pnas.2006991117\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">43% of companies even closed temporarily<\/a>. The ones that did survive,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nutanix.com\/theforecastbynutanix\/news\/cloud-native-adoption-increasing-rapidly-since-pandemic\">78% of them<\/a>&nbsp;took solace in cloud-native models and Kubernetes environments. This can be judged because the cloud-native market saw average spending of $2.3 Billion in 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/press-release\/cloud-native-platform-and-container-management-platforms-market-size-in-2021-with-a-cagr-of-2568-business-demand-market-share-trend-business-news-business-growth-prime-key-players-with-impact-of-domestic-and-global-market-2027-2021-10-24#:~:text=The%20Cloud%20Native%20Platform%20and%20Container%20Management%20Platforms%20market%20revenue,25.68%25%20during%202020%2D2025.\">CAGR rate of 25.68%<\/a>, the cloud-native market size is expected to reach a value of $9.2 Billion by 2025. While they sound similar, cloud-native is the practice of working entirely on the cloud instead of building a data center and then migrating the data to the cloud, which is the cloud hosting methodology. So, what exactly is the difference, and why is cloud-native the superior option? Find out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Reasons to Adopt Cloud-Native<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While cloud hosting is the conventional method of hosting enterprise data, cloud-native is the new normal of data access and storage, just as COVID-19 has changed things. The following are the reasons why businesses of all sizes should adopt cloud-native:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cloud Native is Better than Having On-Premises Servers<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While many would argue that an on-premise server is an excellent investment due to the control it provides, there are concerns as well. For example, backups are less effective with on-premise servers, and in case of a cyber-attack or a natural calamity, all of it may be lost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloud-native allows you to create backups and store them in several locations so that the data can be restored when the services of the cloud resume. Therefore, on-premise server installations have&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/19\/cloud-infrastructure-spending-passed-on-prem-data-centers-in-2020\/\">dropped by 6% to $89 billion globally<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Standard Data Center Hosting Consumes Space and is Less Scalable<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As an organization grows, the challenges of expanding the operations also become extensive. While building data centers at all-new locations may seem easy, the original server is not expandable itself. As a result, data centers are not scalable and consume a lot of space and resources. According to a QTS report, there are&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncsi.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Whitepaper_When-Disaster-Strikes.pdf\">13 vulnerabilities that a data center poses<\/a>. With cloud-native, the user has the flexibility to access the data in a more secure manner that is also easily scalable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Reduces the Time to Hit the Markets&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With data centers, the size, and resources of the service increase as the app or website development scales up. This can&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nutanix.com\/theforecastbynutanix\/technology\/cloud-native-computing-what-it-is-and-why-businesses-need-it\">cost around $5-6 million<\/a>, which is separate from the costs of development. Cloud-native allows you to develop the app\/website in distributed systems and then bring it together when the need arises. This reduces the time to hit the market post-development, which is significantly longer with traditional development practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the additional resources are automatically decommissioned when the usage is complete, making the app\/website light to operate and maintain in the long term. Add the adaptiveness with the Kubernetes environment, and cloud-native automatically becomes the go-to option for development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cloud-Native Enhances Security&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many data center migrations to the cloud do not come with security measures that are fully adaptive for cloud applications. This means that the pre-existing security measures with data centers are not as effective. This is&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/searchcloudsecurity.techtarget.com\/tip\/Cloud-native-security-benefits-and-use-cases#:~:text=Numerous%20categories%20of%20cloud%2Dnative,improve%20security%20programs%20and%20capabilities.&amp;text=cloud%2Dnative%20network%20security%20controls,CloudTrail%20and%20Azure%20Monitor%3B%20and\">solved with cloud-native<\/a>; wherein all security measures are created directly only for the cloud. Furthermore, all the security measures with cloud-native are compliance and regulation friendly, and hence can be deployed almost immediately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Standard Data Center Hosting is Costlier&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most companies choose to build a data center when their data is too sensitive to be stored on a cloud-managed by somebody else. On average, it costs about $1,000 per square foot of area. And to top it off, they consume an enormous amount of power to work. An average data center costs&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.datacenterdynamics.com\/en\/marketwatch\/cutting-data-center-construction-costs-use-supporting-infrastructure-ptss-peter-sacco\/\">$10-12 million per megawatt<\/a>&nbsp;for an enterprise. With cloud-native, these costs can&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/eskala.io\/blog\/the-hidden-costs-of-kubernetes\/\">be reduced by up to 70%<\/a>, with prices starting as low as $100,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cloud-Native vs. Cloud Hosting of Traditional Enterprise Apps?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloud-native had seen its fair share of challenges since the cloud hosting model arrived before and was implemented at a broader scale, with&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/hostingtribunal.com\/blog\/cloud-adoption-statistics\/#gref\">31% of public enterprises stating it imperative<\/a>. However, in 2021, cloud hosting is becoming outdated due to infrastructure requirements and maintenance costs. The following are the broad differences between cloud-native and cloud hosting:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Conclusion: Why Should you Migrate to Cloud-Native?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/eskala.io\/blog\/the-hidden-costs-of-kubernetes\/\">70% of US companies<\/a>&nbsp;already adopting cloud-native architecture and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.crn.com\/news\/cloud\/10-future-cloud-computing-trends-to-watch-in-2021\">complete transformation by 2025<\/a>, it is only a matter of time. Cloud-native packs all the features of its predecessors like higher uptime, lower carbon footprints and adds the benefits of reduced overhead costs and faster implementation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To top it off, it is seamlessly accessible through remote locations for COVID-19 working models and yet manages to adhere to all&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reblaze.com\/blog\/cloud-native-security-benefits-challenges\/\">security measures to prevent data breaches<\/a>. It is thus worthwhile to migrate to cloud-native.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is cloud-native?
