The fourth transition that has already occurred is data-centric computing, which will be driven mainly by the growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grandviewresearch.com\/industry-analysis\/artificial-intelligence-ai-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a study by market research firm Grand View Research<\/a>, <strong>the global AI market was valued at $136.6 billion in 2022<\/strong> and is <strong>projected to reach $1,811.8 billion by 2030<\/strong>, expanding at a CAGR of 38.1% over the forecast period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll look at seven different industries that are being transformed by AI currently. But first, let&#8217;s understand what artificial intelligence is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Understanding Artificial Intelligence (AI) <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The overuse of the term &#8220;artificial intelligence&#8221; is becoming annoying. It is used interchangeably with any application powered by cutting-edge technology, hindering its true meaning and objective. Therefore, defining AI and its applications for industrial companies is important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI refers to the ability of computer systems or computer-controlled robots to perform problem-solving and decision-making tasks typically associated with human intelligence. These tasks include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Recognizing images and speech<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Translating languages<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Providing recommendations<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Making decisions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>And more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In simple terms, a machine&#8217;s ability to carry out cognitive processes typically associated with human minds, including sensing, thinking, learning, interacting with the environment, and problem-solving, is known as artificial intelligence (AI). Some examples of AI technologies include <strong>machine learning (ML), robotics, computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), virtual assistants, and autonomous vehicles (AVs).<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How Companies Use AI&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One industrial sector in which AI is adding value is enhancing knowledge workers&#8217; capabilities, particularly engineers. Such applications primarily make use of AI&#8217;s predictive skills. Companies are discovering new ways to reframe conventional business problems so that AI can leverage ML algorithms to evaluate data and experiences, identify patterns, and make predictions accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, companies use AI in three significant ways:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Developing more intelligent products<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Providing smarter services<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improving internal business processes and operations<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/capabilities\/quantumblack\/our-insights\/the-state-of-ai-in-2022-and-a-half-decade-in-review#review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2022 survey by consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company<\/a> indicated that while the adoption of AI globally is 2.5x higher today than in 2017, it has leveled off in the past few years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the study, <strong>20% of respondents said they had adopted AI in at least one business area in 2017. Today, that number is 50%, though it reached an all-time high of 58% in 2019.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the <strong>average amount of AI capabilities that businesses leverage has doubled from 1.9 in 2018 to 3.8 in 2022<\/strong>. Examples include computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). While NLP has advanced from the middle of the pack in 2018 to the top of the list just behind computer vision, robotic process <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/capabilities\/operations\/our-insights\/your-questions-about-automation-answered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">automation<\/a> and computer vision has continued to be the most frequently deployed among these capabilities each year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is transforming and revolutionizing businesses across the world, irrespective of their shapes or sizes, across all industries. This includes providing opportunities for developing countries to thrive or for drug discovery. Professionals across all industry sectors must know how AI functions, regardless of their field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step to influencing AI strategy within your organization and being at the forefront of the future is learning about how AI is transforming businesses worldwide and how you can capitalize on these changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, let&#8217;s jump right in!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AI Use Cases &amp; Applications Across Different Industries<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI applications range from consumer-based solutions (like chatbots) to highly complex industrial use cases, such as financial services or warehouse automation, to improve the interoperability of vehicles using IoT.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at some significant AI use cases and applications reforming major industries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li><strong>Healthcare <\/strong>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The contribution of tech giants like Facebook, Microsoft, IBM, Google, and Apple in the healthcare sector holds great importance for the industry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is currently being leveraged for a variety of healthcare services, including <strong>medical imaging, medication management, drug development, robotic surgery, and data mining for pattern recognition<\/strong> and, subsequently, more <strong>precise diagnosis and treatment of medical disorders<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/watson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IBM Watson<\/a> can evaluate a patient&#8217;s medical record to find potential treatments. The AI tool derives the meaning and context of a set of structured and unstructured data that may be important for choosing a treatment plan. In other words, IBM Watson functions like an actual physician.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, a biopharmaceutical company called <a href=\"https:\/\/numedii.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NuMedii<\/a> is disrupting drug discovery through big data and AI leveraging its <strong>Artificial Intelligence for Drug Discovery (AIDD) platform<\/strong>. The company uses the platform to discover novel mechanisms, cell types, targets and biomarkers, which will be influential in identifying and developing precision therapies for diseases.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Telecommunications<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>While many of us frequently take the availability of the Internet and communications for granted, the telecommunications sector depends on several highly complex processes and constant modifications.
