Along with a people-centric culture, a crucial part of its success has been providing clients with individuals trained in innovative and disruptive technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under this context of expansion and to continue providing high-quality services, we are thrilled to welcome Michael Chu to the TechBlocks family as our VP Digital Product &amp; Strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Extensive Experience in Driving Digital Transformation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael brings a wealth of experience spanning two decades in the tech industry, working in varying roles, including Solutions Architect, Technical Consultant, Product Manager, and Developer.

One of the reasons I was keenly interested in working with TechBlocks is that I&#8217;m very passionate about healthcare and e-commerce, which happen to be strategic areas of focus for the company. I look forward to helping TechBlocks maintain its position at the forefront of digital transformation,&#8221; Michael says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael&#8217;s expertise in digital transformation, enterprise architecture, product strategy, and global market scale is essential to TechBlocks&#8217; commitment to innovation and operational excellence as our company organization grows and expands into new markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael is based in Vancouver, Canada, and holds an International Master of Business Administration (IMBA) degree from York University and a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology from Dalhousie University.
